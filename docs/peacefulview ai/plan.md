## Proposed Plan for an AI-Generated Peaceful View (Replacing YouTube with Mux)

Below is a high-level outline of how we can replace the current YouTube video with a “streamed” video generated by AI via Replicate, merged with AI-generated audio, and uploaded to Mux. Additionally, we’ll keep all AI-generated clips at or under 10 seconds to ensure quick generation and user-friendly playback.

### 1. Generate Music with Replicate

- Use the [minimax/music-01](https://replicate.com/minimax/music-01/api) model to generate a short audio clip (≤10 seconds).  
- Call the Replicate API from Python (in your Appwrite “@functions” directory, for instance), passing in an appropriate prompt describing the music.

```python:functions/starter-function/src/main.py
import replicate

def generate_music():
    # Replace with your actual model/version
    model = replicate.models.get("minimax/music-01")
    version = model.versions.get("MODEL_VERSION_ID")
    output = version.predict(prompt="peaceful ambient music for meditation, under 10 seconds")
    # 'output' might be a URL to the generated audio file
    return output
```

### 2. Generate Video with Replicate

- Use [arielreplicate/stable_diffusion_infinite_zoom](https://replicate.com/arielreplicate/stable_diffusion_infinite_zoom) to produce a short video (<10 seconds).  
- Same approach: call the API from your Python function with a suitable prompt (e.g. “peaceful infinite zoom landscape, under 10 seconds”).

```python:functions/starter-function/src/main.py
def generate_video():
    # Replace with your actual model/version
    model = replicate.models.get("arielreplicate/stable_diffusion_infinite_zoom")
    version = model.versions.get("MODEL_VERSION_ID")
    output = version.predict(prompt="serene infinite zoom landscape, under 10 seconds")
    # 'output' is a URL to the generated video file
    return output
```

---

### 3. Merge Audio & Video with FFmpeg

- Download both generated files (audio & video) inside your Python function.  
- Use FFmpeg to merge them. If they’re both around 10 seconds, they should sync easily.  
- Follow Mux’s merging guide, for example:

```bash
ffmpeg -i short_ai_video.mp4 -i short_ai_audio.mp3 \
       -c:v copy -c:a aac \
       -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 \
       merged_output.mp4
```

If you want it on a continuous loop, you can also explore looping flags or re-encode the files for repeated playback.

---

### 4. Upload the Merged Output to Mux

1. **Simulated Live (RTMP Approach):**  
   - Push the merged video on a loop to Mux’s RTMP endpoint.  
2. **VOD Upload Approach (Simpler):**  
   - Upload `merged_output.mp4` to Mux as a standard On-Demand asset.  
   - Retrieve the HLS playback URL from Mux.

---

### 5. Replace the YouTube Video in `PeacefulView.swift`

- Remove or comment out the current `YouTubePlayerView`.  
- Create a SwiftUI-based Mux or AVPlayer view. For example, using `AVPlayer`:

```swift:TikTokClone/TikTokClone/Views/PeacefulView.swift
import SwiftUI
import AVKit

struct MuxPlayerView: View {
    let muxUrl: URL
    @State private var avPlayer = AVPlayer()

    var body: some View {
        VideoPlayer(player: avPlayer)
            .onAppear {
                let item = AVPlayerItem(url: muxUrl)
                avPlayer.replaceCurrentItem(with: item)
                avPlayer.play()
            }
    }
}

struct PeacefulView: View {
    // ... existing code

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Replacing YouTube with Mux
            MuxPlayerView(muxUrl: URL(string: "https://stream.mux.com/<YOUR_PLAYBACK_ID>.m3u8")!)
            
            // Keep your existing emoji overlay, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Maintain Emoji Reactions

- Your real-time emoji logic from Appwrite remains the same.  
- All you’ve changed is the underlying video source.

---

### 7. (Optional) Automate Periodic Generation

- Create a scheduled job or use Appwrite’s function scheduler to:  
  1. Generate fresh audio & video slices (≤10s).  
  2. Merge them with FFmpeg.  
  3. Push the final artifact to Mux.  
  4. Update your front-end with the new Mux playback URL.  

Users will see brand-new AI-generated peaceful content each time they open the view.

## Final Thoughts

By generating short (≤10s) AI music and video, merging with FFmpeg, uploading to Mux, and replacing the YouTube view with a Mux-based (or AVPlayer) component, you can achieve a customized AI-driven “PeacefulView” that still leverages your existing emoji reaction flow. Good luck!
